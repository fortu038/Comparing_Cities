# Comparing_Cities

## Description

The goal of this project was to use local stoarge, API calls, and skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a functional website from scratch. The created website acts as a city search and comparison tool. During this project I practiced working with APIs, creating website pages using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and refined my group work skills.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

This website acts as a city comparison website. Users can enter up to three city names and then can click search. If less than three city names are entered, an alert will pop up and ask the user if they wish to enter another city before continuing. Upon reaching the comparisons page users will see various statistics for each city displayed, with each statistic being aligned with the matching ones of other cties. A graph displaying each city's overall scores in certain fields is dispalyed at the bottom of the page along with a red "Return to Search Page" button that sends users back to the initial search page when clicked. Cities entered will be saved between sessions as long as local storage is not cleared.
